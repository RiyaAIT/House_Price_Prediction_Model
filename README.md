# House_Price_Prediction_Model
The "House Price Prediction" project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost, this project provides an end-to-end solution for accurate price estimation

#Project_Overview
The "House Price Prediction" project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict housing prices based on various features. This prediction task is of great significance in real estate and finance, enabling informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors. By employing machine learning algorithms and a curated dataset, this project provides a powerful tool for estimating house prices.
